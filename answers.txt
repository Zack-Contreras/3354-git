c) git log -> shows history of commits, shows project history
   git status -> inspect current working directory and staging area

e) git checkout -> allows you to checkout or navigate to different branches created by the git project
   git reset -> takes current branch and resets it to point somewhere else and can bring the index and work tree with it. Will remove commits.
